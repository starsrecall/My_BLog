Welcome!
--------

*   In previous weeks, you were introduced to the fundamental building blocks of programming.
*   You learned about programming in a lower-level programming language called C.
*   Today, we are going to work with a higher-level programming language called _Python_.
*   As you learn this new language, you’re going to find that you are going to be more able to teach yourself new programming languages.

Hello Python!
-------------

*   Humans, over the decades, have seen how previous design decisions made in prior programming languages could be improved upon.
*   Python is a programming language that builds upon what you have already learned in C.
*   Python additionally has access to a vast number of user-created libraries.
*   Unlike in C, which is a _compiled language_, Python is an _interpreted language_, where you need not separately compile your program. Instead, you run your program in the _Python Interpreter_.
*   Up until this point, the code has looked like this:
    
    ```c
    // A program that says hello to the world
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        printf("hello, world\n");
    }
    
    ```
    
    Notice how this C program is more complex than the Python version below. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello0.c?download).
    
*   Today, you’ll find that the process of writing and compiling code has been simplified.
*   For example, the above code will be rendered in Python as:
    
    ```python
    # A program that says hello to the world
    print("hello, world")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the semicolon is gone and that no library is needed. You can run this program in your terminal by typing `python hello.py`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello0.py?download).
    
*   Python notably can implement what was quite complicated in C with relative simplicity.
*   Among the goals of this week is to be _more comfortable with being uncomfortable_ not knowing exactly how to solve a problem or correctly, syntactically implement a solution: Searching yourself for resources to help you (within the course’s academic honesty policy)!

Speller
-------

*   To illustrate this simplicity, let’s type ‘code dictionary.py’ in the terminal window and write code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Words in dictionary
    words = set()
    
    def check(word):
        """Return true if word is in dictionary else false"""
        return word.lower() in words
    
    def load(dictionary):
        """Load dictionary into memory, returning true if successful else false"""
        with open(dictionary) as file:
            words.update(file.read().splitlines())
        return True
    
    def size():
        """Returns number of words in dictionary if loaded else 0 if not yet loaded"""
        return len(words)
    
    def unload():
        """Unloads dictionary from memory, returning true if successful else false"""
        return True
    
    ```
    
    Notice that there are four functions above. In the `check` function, if a `word` is in `words`, it returns `True`. It is so much easier than an implementation in C! Similarly, in the `load` function, the dictionary file is opened. For each line in that file, we add that line to `words`. Using `rstrip`, the trailing new line is removed from the added word. `size` simply returns the `len` or length of `words`. `unload` only needs to return `True` because Python handles memory management on its own. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/speller/dictionary.py?download).
    
*   The above code illustrates why higher-level languages exist: To simplify and allow you to write code more easily.
*   However, speed is a tradeoff. Because C allows you, the programmer, to make decisions about memory management, it may run faster than Python – depending on your code. While C only runs your lines of code, Python runs all the code that comes under the hood with it when you call Python’s built-in functions.
*   You can learn more about functions in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

Filter
------

*   To further illustrate this simplicity, create a new file by typing `code blur.py` in your terminal window and write code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Blurs an image
    from PIL import Image, ImageFilter
    
    # Blur image
    before = Image.open("bridge.bmp")
    after = before.filter(ImageFilter.BoxBlur(1))
    after.save("out.bmp")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that this program imports modules `Image` and `ImageFilter` from a library called `PIL`. This takes an input file and creates an output file. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/filter/blur.py?download).
    
*   Further, you can create a new file called `edges.py` as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Blurs an image
    from PIL import Image, ImageFilter
    
    # Find edges
    before = Image.open("bridge.bmp")
    after = before.filter(ImageFilter.FIND_EDGES)
    after.save("out.bmp")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that this code is a small adjustment to your `blur` code but produces a dramatically different result. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/filter/edges.py?download).
    
*   Python allows you to abstract away programming that would be much more complicated within C and other _lower-level_ programming languages.
*   One of the trade-offs of using Python is an interpreted language, instead of being compiled (as we strictly defined earlier in the course). Accordingly, there is some (usually very small) slow-down that may not be expected in a compiled program.

Functions
---------

*   In C, you may have seen functions as follows:
    
    ```c
    printf("hello, world\n");
    ```
    
*   In Python, you will see functions as follows:
    
    ```python
    print("hello, world")
    ```
    

Libraries, Modules, and Packages
--------------------------------

*   As with C, the CS50 library can be utilized within Python.
*   The following functions will be of particular use:
    
    ```tex
      get_float
      get_int
      get_string
    ```
    
*   You can import the cs50 library as follows:
    
    ```python
    import cs50
    ```
    
*   You also have the option of importing only specific functions from the CS50 library as follows:
    
    ```python
    from cs50 import get_float, get_int, get_string
    ```
    

Strings
-------

*   In C, you might remember this code:
    
    ```c
    // get_string and printf with %s
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        string answer = get_string("What's your name? ");
        printf("hello, %s\n", answer);
    }
    ```
    
    Notice how this C program uses the CS50 library to get user input. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello1.c?download).
    
*   This code is transformed in Python to:
    
    ```python
    # get_string and print, with concatenation
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
    print("hello, " + answer)
    
    ```
    
    You can write this code by executing `code hello.py` in the terminal window. Then, you can execute this code by running `python hello.py`. Notice how the `+` sign concatenates `"hello, "` and `answer`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello1.py?download).
    
*   Similarly, this can be done without concatenation:
    
    ```python
    # get_string and print, without concatenation
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    answer = get_string("What's your name? ")
    print("hello,", answer)
    ```
    
    Notice that the print statement automatically creates a space between the `hello` statement and the `answer`.
    
*   Similarly, you could implement the above code as:
    
    ```python
    # get_string and print, with format strings
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    answer  = get_string("What's your name? ")
    print(f"hello, {answer}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the curly braces allow for the `print` function to interpolate the `answer` such that `answer` appears within. The `f` is required to include the `answer` properly formatting. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/hello2.py?download).
    

Positional Parameters and Named Parameters
------------------------------------------

*   Functions in C like `fread`, `fwrite`, and `printf` use positional arguments, where you provide arguments with commas as separators. You, the programmer, must remember what argument is in which position. These are referred to as _positional arguments_.
*   In Python, _named parameters_ allow you to provide arguments without regard to positionality.
*   You can learn more about the parameters of the `print` function in the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print).
*   Accessing that documentation, you may see the following:
    
    ```python
    print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that various objects can be provided to print. A separator of a single space is provided that will display when more than one object is given to `print`. Similarly, a new line is provided at the end of the `print` statement.
    

Variables
---------

*   Variable declaration is simplified too. In C, you might have `int counter = 0;`. In Python, this same line would read `counter = 0`. You need not declare the type of the variable.
*   Python favors `counter += 1` to increment by one, losing the ability found in C to type `counter++`.

Types
-----

*   Data types in Python do not need to be explicitly declared. For example, you saw how `answer` above is a string, but we did not have to tell the interpreter this was the case: It knew on its own.
*   In Python, commonly used types include:
    
    ```tex
      bool
      float
      int
      str
    
    ```
    
    Notice that `long` and `double` are missing. Python will handle what data type should be used for larger and smaller numbers.
    
*   Some other data types in Python include:
    
    ```python
    range   sequence of numbers
    list    sequence of mutable values
    tuple   sequence of immutable values
    dict    collection of key-value pairs
    set     collection of unique values
    
    ```
    
*   Each of these data types can be implemented in C, but in Python, they can be implemented more simply.

Calculator
----------

*   You might recall `calculator.c` from earlier in the course:
    
    ```c
    // Addition with int
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        // Prompt user for x
        int x = get_int("x: ");
    
        // Prompt user for y
        int y = get_int("y: ");
    
        // Perform addition
        printf("%i\n", x + y);
    }
    
    ```
    
    Notice this C implementation of a simple calculator. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator0.c?download).
    
*   We can implement a simple calculator just as we did within C. Type `code calculator.py` into the terminal window and write code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Addition with int [using get_int]
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    # Prompt user for x
    x = get_int("x: ")
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = get_int("y: ")
    
    # Perform addition
    print(x + y)
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the CS50 library is imported. Then, `x` and `y` are gathered from the user. Finally, the result is printed. Notice that the `main` function that would have been seen in a C program is gone entirely! While one could utilize a `main` function, it is not required. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator0.py?download).
    
*   It’s possible for one to remove the training wheels of the CS50 library. Modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Addition with int [using input]
    # Prompt user for x
    x = input("x: ")
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = input("y: ")
    
    # Perform addition
    print(x + y)
    
    ```
    
    Notice how executing the above code results in strange program behavior. Why might this be so?
    
*   You may have guessed that the interpreter understood `x` and `y` to be strings. You can fix your code by employing the `int` function as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Addition with int [using input]
    # Prompt user for x
    x = int(input("x: "))
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = int(input("y: "))
    
    # Perform addition
    print(x + y)
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the input for `x` and `y` is passed to the `int` function, which converts it to an integer. Without converting `x` and `y` to be integers, the characters will concatenate. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator1.py?download).
    

Conditionals
------------

*   In C, you might remember a program like this:
    
    ```c
    // Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        // Prompt user for integers
        int x = get_int("What's x? ");
        int y = get_int("What's y? ");
    
        // Compare integers
        if (x < y)
        {
            printf("x is less than y\n");
        }
        else if (x > y)
        {
            printf("x is greater than y\n");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("x is equal to y\n");
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
    Notice how conditionals work in C. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/compare3.c?download).
    
*   In Python, it would appear as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Conditionals, Boolean expressions, relational operators
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    # Prompt user for integers
    x = get_int("What's x? ")
    y = get_int("What's y? ")
    
    # Compare integers
    if x < y:
        print("x is less than y")
    elif x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x is equal to y")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that there are no more curly braces. Instead, indentations are utilized. Second, a colon is utilized in the `if` statement. Further, `elif` replaces `else if`. Parentheses are also no longer required in the `if` and `elif` statements. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/compare3.py?download).
    
*   Further looking at comparisons, consider the following code in C:
    
    ```c
    // Logical operators
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        // Prompt user to agree
        char c = get_char("Do you agree? ");
    
        // Check whether agreed
        if (c == 'Y' || c == 'y')
        {
            printf("Agreed.\n");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("Not agreed.\n");
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
    Notice how logical operators work in C. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/agree2.c?download).
    
*   The above can be implemented as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Logical operators
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    # Prompt user to agree
    s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
    
    # Check whether agreed
    if s == "Y" or s == "y":
        print("Agreed.")
    else:
        print("Not agreed.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the two vertical bars utilized in C is replaced with `or`. Indeed, people often enjoy Python because it is more readable by humans. Also, notice that `char` does not exist in Python. Instead, `str`s are utilized. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/agree2.py?download).
    
*   Another approach to this same code could be as follows using _lists_:
    
    ```python
    # Logical operators, using lists
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    # Prompt user to agree
    s = get_string("Do you agree? ")
    
    # Check whether agreed
    if s in ["y", "yes"]:
        print("Agreed.")
    else:
        print("Not agreed.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how we are able to express multiple keywords like `y` and `yes` in a `list`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/agree1.py?download).
    

Object-Oriented Programming
---------------------------

*   It’s possible to have certain types of values not only have properties or attributes inside of them but have functions as well. In Python, these values are known as _objects_
*   In C, we could create a `struct` where you could associate multiple variables inside a single self-created data type. In Python, we can do this and also include functions in a self-created data type. When a function belongs to a specific _object_, it is known as a _method_.
*   For example, `strs` in Python have built-in _methods_. Therefore, you could modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Logical operators, using lists
    # Prompt user to agree
    s = input("Do you agree? ").lower()
    
    # Check whether agreed
    if s in ["y", "yes"]:
        print("Agreed.")
    else:
        print("Not agreed.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how we use `s.lower()` to normalize input, using the built-in `lower` method of `strs`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/agree2.py?download).
    
*   Similarly, you may recall how we copied a string in C:
    
    ```c
    // Capitalizes a copy of a string without memory errors
    
    #include <cs50.h>
    #include <ctype.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <string.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        // Get a string
        char *s = get_string("s: ");
        if (s == NULL)
        {
            return 1;
        }
    
        // Allocate memory for another string
        char *t = malloc(strlen(s) + 1);
        if (t == NULL)
        {
            return 1;
        }
    
        // Copy string into memory
        strcpy(t, s);
    
        // Capitalize copy
        if (strlen(t) > 0)
        {
            t[0] = toupper(t[0]);
        }
    
        // Print strings
        printf("s: %s\n", s);
        printf("t: %s\n", t);
    
        // Free memory
        free(t);
        return 0;
    }
    
    ```
    
    Notice the number of lines of code. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/copy5.c?download).
    
*   We may implement the above in Python as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Capitalizes a copy of a string
    # Get a string
    s = input("s: ")
    
    # Capitalize copy of string
    t = s.capitalize()
    
    # Print strings
    print(f"s: {s}")
    print(f"t: {t}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how much shorter this program is than its counterpart in C. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/copy.py?download).
    
*   In this class, we will only scratch the surface of Python. Therefore, the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/) will be of particular importance as you continue.
*   You can learn more about string methods in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)

Loops
-----

*   Loops in Python are very similar to C. You may recall the following code in C:
    
    ```c
    // Demonstrates for loop
    
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        {
            printf("meow\n");
        }
    }
    
    ```
    
*   `for` loops can be implemented in Python as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Better design
    for i in range(3):
        print("meow")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that `i` is never explicitly used. However, Python will increment the value of `i`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/cat3.py?download).
    
*   Further, a `while` loop could be implemented as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Demonstrates while loop
    i = 0
    while i < 3:
        print("meow")
        i += 1
    
    ```
    
    You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/cat1.py?download).
    
*   To further our understanding of loops and iteration in Python, let’s create a new file called `uppercase.py` as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Uppercases string one character at a time
    before = input("Before: ")
    print("After:  ", end="")
    for c in before:
        print(c.upper(), end="")
    print()
    
    ```
    
    Notice how `end=` is used to pass a parameter to the `print` function that continues the line without a line ending. This code passes one string at a time. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/uppercase0.py?download).
    
*   Reading the documentation, we discover that Python has methods that can be implemented upon the entire string as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Uppercases string all at once
    before = input("Before: ")
    after = before.upper()
    print(f"After:  {after}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how `.upper` is applied to the entire string. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/uppercase1.py?download).
    

Abstraction
-----------

*   As we hinted at earlier today, you can further improve upon our code using functions and abstracting away various code into functions. Modify your earlier-created `meow.py` code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Abstraction
    def main():
        for i in range(3):
            meow()
    
    # Meow once
    def meow():
        print("meow")
    
    main()
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the `meow` function abstracts away the `print` statement. Further, notice that the `main` function appears at the top of the file. At the bottom of the file, the `main` function is called. By convention, it’s expected that you create a `main` function in Python. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/cat4.py?download).
    
*   Indeed, we can pass variables between our functions as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Abstraction with parameterization
    def main():
        meow(3)
    
    # Meow some number of times
    def meow(n):
        for i in range(n):
            print("meow")
    
    main()
    
    ```
    
    Notice how `meow` now takes a variable `n`. In the `main` function, you can call `meow` and pass a value like `3` to it. Then, `meow` utilizes the value of `n` in the `for` loop. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/cat5.py?download).
    
*   Reading the above code, notice how you, as a C programmer, are able to quite easily make sense of the above code. While some conventions are different, the building blocks you previously learned are very apparent in this new programming language.
    

Truncation and Floating Point Imprecision
-----------------------------------------

*   Recall that in C, we experienced truncation where one integer is divided by another could result in an imprecise result.
*   You can see how Python handles such division as follows by modifying your code for `calculator.py`:
    
    ```python
    # Division with integers, demonstration lack of truncation
    # Prompt user for x
    x = int(input("x: "))
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = int(input("y: "))
    
    # Divide x by y
    z = x / y
    print(z)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that executing this code results in a value, but that if you were to see more digits after `.333333` you’d see that we are faced with _floating-point imprecision_. Truncation does not occur. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator2.py?download).
    
*   We can reveal this imprecision by modifying our codes slightly:
    
    ```python
    # Floating-point imprecision
    # Prompt user for x
    x = int(input("x: "))
    
    # Prompt user for y
    y = int(input("y: "))
    
    # Divide x by y
    z = x / y
    print(f"{z:.50f}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that this code reveals the imprecision. Python still faces this issue, just as C does. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/calculator3.py?download).
    

Exceptions
----------

*   Let’s explore more about exceptions that can occur when we run Python code.
*   Modify `integer.py` as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Doesn't handle exception
    # Prompt user for an integer
    n = int(input("Input: "))
    print("Integer")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that inputting the wrong data could result in an error. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/integer/integer1.py?download).
    
*   We can `try` to handle and _catch_ potential exceptions by modifying our code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Handles exception
    # Prompt user for an integer
    try:
        n = int(input("Input: "))
        print("Integer.")
    except ValueError:
        print("Not integer.")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the above code repeatedly tries to get the correct type of data, providing additional prompts when needed. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/6/integer/integer2.py?download).
    

Mario
-----

*   Recall a few weeks ago our challenge of building three blocks on top of one another, like in Mario.
    
    ![three vertical blocks](./week_6_note_English.assets/cs50Week6Slide073.png)
    
*   In Python, we can implement something akin to this as follows:
    
    ```
    # Prints a column of 3 bricks with a loop
    for i in range(3):
        print("#")
    
    ```
    
    This prints a column of three bricks. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario0.py?download).
    
*   In C, we had the advantage of a `do-while` loop. However, in Python, it is conventional to utilize a `while` loop, as Python does not have a `do-while` loop. You can write code as follows in a file called `mario.py`:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a column of n bricks with a loop
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    while True:
        n = get_int("Height: ")
        if n > 0:
            break
    
    for i in range(n):
        print("#")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how the while loop is used to obtain the height. Once a height greater than zero is inputted, the loop breaks. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario1.py?download).
    
*   Consider the following image:
    
    ![four horizontal question blocks](./week_6_note_English.assets/cs50Week6Slide075.png)
    
*   In Python, we could implement by modifying your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a row of 4 question marks with a loop
    for i in range(4):
        print("?", end="")
    print()
    
    ```
    
    Notice that you can override the behavior of the `print` function to stay on the same line as the previous print. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario2.py?download).
    
*   Similar in spirit to previous iterations, we can further simplify this program:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a row of 4 question marks without a loop
    print("?" * 4)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that we can utilize `*` to multiply the print statement to repeat `4` times. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario3.py?download).
    
*   What about a large block of bricks?
    
    ![three by three block of mario blocks](./week_6_note_English.assets/cs50Week6Slide078.png)
    
*   To implement the above, you can modify your code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a 3-by-3 grid of bricks with loops
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            print("#", end="")
        print()
    
    ```
    
    Notice how one `for` loop exists inside another. The `print` statement adds a new line at the end of each row of bricks. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/1/mario4.py?download).
    
*   You can learn more about the `print` function in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)
    

Lists
-----

*   `list`s are a data structure within Python.
*   `list`s have built-in methods or functions within them.
*   For example, consider the following code:
    
    ```python
    # Averages three numbers using a list
    # Scores
    scores = [72, 73, 33]
    
    # Print average
    average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"Average: {average}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that you can use the built-in `sum` method to calculate the average. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/scores0.py?download).
    
*   You can even utilize the following syntax to get values from the user:
    
    ```python
    # Averages three numbers using a list and a loop
    from cs50 import get_int
    
    # Get scores
    scores = []
    for i in range(3):
        score = get_int("Score: ")
        scores.append(score)
    
    # Print average
    average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
    print(f"Average: {average}")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that this code utilizes the built-in `append` method for lists. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/scores1.py?download).
    
*   You can learn more about lists in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
*   You can also learn more about `len` in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len)

Searching and Dictionaries
--------------------------

*   We can also search within a data structure.
*   Consider a program called `phonebook.py` as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Implements linear search for names using loop
    # A list of names
    names = ["Kelly", "David", "John"]
    
    # Ask for name
    name = input("Name: ")
    
    # Search for name
    for n in names:
        if name == n:
            print("Found")
            break
    else:
        print("Not found")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how this implements linear search for each name. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook0.py?download).
    
*   However, we don’t need to iterate through a list. In Python, we can execute linear search as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Implements linear search for names using `in`
    # A list of names
    names = ["Kelly", "David", "John"]
    
    # Ask for name
    name = input("Name: ")
    
    # Search for name
    if name in names:
        print("Found")
    else:
        print("Not found")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how `in` is used to implement linear search. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook1.py?download).
    
*   Still, this code could be improved.
*   Recall that a _dictionary_ or `dict` is a collection of _key_ and _value_ pairs.
*   You can implement a dictionary in Python as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Implements a phone book as a list of dictionaries, without a variable
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    people = [
        {"name": "Kelly", "number": "+1-617-495-1000"},
        {"name": "David", "number": "+1-617-495-1000"},
        {"name": "John", "number": "+1-949-468-2750"},
    ]
    
    # Search for name
    name = get_string("Name: ")
    for person in people:
        if person["name"] == name:
            print(f"Found {person['number']}")
            break
    else:
        print("Not found")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the dictionary is implemented having both `name` and `number` for each entry. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook2.py?download).
    
*   Even better, strictly speaking, we don’t need both a `name` and a `number`. We can simplify this code as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Implements a phone book using a dictionary
    from cs50 import get_string
    
    people = {
        "Kelly": "+1-617-495-1000",
        "David": "+1-617-495-1000",
        "John": "+1-949-468-2750",
    }
    
    # Search for name
    name = get_string("Name: ")
    if name in people:
        print(f"Number: {people[name]}")
    else:
        print("Not found")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the dictionary is implemented using curly braces. Then, the statement `if name in people` searches to see if the `name` is in the `people` dictionary. Further, notice how, in the `print` statement, we can index into the people dictionary using the value of `name`. Very useful! You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook4.py?download).
    
*   Similarly, one could implement a list of dictionaries:
    
    ```python
    # Implements a phone book as a list of dictionaries
    people = [
        {"name": "Kelly", "number": "+1-617-495-1000"},
        {"name": "David", "number": "+1-617-495-1000"},
        {"name": "John", "number": "+1-949-468-2750"},
    ]
    
    # Search for name
    name = input("Name: ")
    for person in people:
        if person["name"] == name:
            number = person["number"]
            print(f"Found {number}")
            break
    else:
        print("Not found")
    
    ```
    
    Notice how `people` is implemented as a list of dictionaries, separated by commas. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/3/phonebook3.py?download).
    
*   Python has done their best to get to _constant time_ using their built-in searches.
*   You can learn more about dictionaries in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict)

Command-Line Arguments
----------------------

*   As with C, you can also utilize command-line arguments. Consider the following code:
    
    ```python
    # Prints a command-line argument
    from sys import argv
    
    if len(argv) == 2:
        print(f"hello, {argv[1]}")
    else:
        print("hello, world")
    
    ```
    
    Notice that `argv[1]` is printed using a _formatted string_, noted by the `f` present in the `print` statement. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/greet.py?download).
    
*   You can learn more about the `sys` library in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)
    

Exit Status
-----------

*   The `sys` library also has built-in methods. We can use `sys.exit(i)` to exit the program with a specific exit code:
    
    ```python
    # Exits with explicit value, importing sys
    import sys
    
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Missing command-line argument")
        sys.exit(1)
    
    print(f"hello, {sys.argv[1]}")
    sys.exit(0)
    
    ```
    
    Notice that dot-notation is used to utilize the built-in functions of `sys`. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/2/exit.py?download).
    

CSV Files
---------

*   Python also has built-in support for CSV files.
*   Modify your code for `phonebook.py` as follows:
    
    ```python
    import csv
    
    file = open("phonebook.csv", "a")
    
    name = input("Name: ")
    number = input("Number: ")
    
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([name,number])
    
    file.close()
    
    ```
    
    Notice `writerow` adds the commas in the CSV file for us. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/phonebook0.py?download).
    
*   While `file.close` and `file = open` are commonly used and available syntax in Python, this code can be improved as follows:
    
    ```python
    # Uses `with`
    import csv
    
    # Get name and number
    name = input("Name: ")
    number = input("Number: ")
    
    # Open CSV file
    with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:
    
        # Print to file
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow([name, number])
    
    ```
    
    Notice that the code is indented under the `with` statement. This automatically closes the file when done. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/phonebook1.py?download).
    
*   Similarly, we can write a dictionary as follows within the CSV file:
    
    ```python
    import csv
    
    name = input("Name: ")
    number = input("Number: ")
    
    with open("phonebook.csv", "a") as file:
    
        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["name", "number"])
        writer.writerow({"name": name, "number": number})
    
    ```
    
    Notice this code is quite similar to our prior iteration but with `csv.DictWriter` instead. You can download this code [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/2025/fall/lectures/6/src6/4/phonebook2.py?download).
    

Third-Party Libraries
---------------------

*   One of the advantages of Python is its massive user base and similarly large number of third-party libraries.
*   You can install the CS50 Library on your own computer by typing `pip install cs50`, provided you have [Python](https://python.org/) installed.
*   Considering other libraries, David demoed the use of `cowsay` and `qrcode`.

Summing Up
